## 📍 Overview

The project located at https://github.com/Abhijith14/Wumpus-World-POL--Symbolic-AI is centered around implementing a Wumpus World game using symbolic artificial intelligence. The core functionality of the project is to build an intelligent agent that can navigate a grid-based world, avoiding obstacles and finding the optimal path to reach its goal while considering the rules and logic of the game. The project's purpose is to showcase the application of symbolic AI techniques in solving complex problems like game playing, offering considerable value in understanding logic-based reasoning and decision-making algorithms.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The project follows a procedural design with the main code split into multiple modules and functions for each logic. It uses a custom implementation of the Wumpus World game in a symbolic AI approach. |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The repository does not have extensive documentation. Some functions and classes have docstrings, but overall, the documentation is limited. |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | There are no external dependencies for this project. It relies solely on the Python standard library. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The project demonstrates modularity by separating different aspects of the game into separate modules. Each module focuses on a specific functionality, making it easier to maintain and expand upon. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The testing strategy for this project is not mentioned in the repository. It does not contain any automated tests or test cases. |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**    | The performance of the system cannot be determined without running and analyzing the code. However, the symbolic AI approach used in the project may lead to slower execution compared to other AI paradigms. |
| 🔐 | **Security**       | There are no specific security measures mentioned in the repository. The codebase focuses on implementing the Wumpus World game's logic rather than security-related aspects. |
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository utilizes Git for version control. It contains multiple commits, suggesting regular updates and version tracking. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The project does not have any explicit integrations with external systems or services. |
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | The codebase does not mention or demonstrate scalability considerations. It is primarily designed for the Wumpus World game and not focused on handling significant growth or scaling. |
